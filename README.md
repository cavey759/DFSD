# DFSD
 A DFSD dataset of dragon fruit stem diseases, with 10,170 images across 13 classes, was field-collected. (Paper under review; dataset to be supplemented later.) It differentiates early/middle-to-late stages of canker and black spot, aiming to detect early symptoms, support early intervention, and curb disease spread.
