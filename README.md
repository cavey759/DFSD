## DFSD Dragon Fruit Stem Diseases Dataset
This dataset was systematically collected and annotated in natural field environments, containing 10,170 images covering 13 classes of dragon fruit stem diseases and healthy states. Currently, the related research paper is undergoing peer review at an international journal, with the dataset being continuously updated in parallel.

## Core Advantages & Values
The dataset focuses on two major diseases (canker and black spot), providing detailed annotations of early and middle-to-late stages developments. It supports the development of early disease detection algorithms by offering multi-class samples under complex field backgrounds. This enables precise disease control for farmers, reduces chemical pesticide usage, and promotes the advancement of smart agriculture.
